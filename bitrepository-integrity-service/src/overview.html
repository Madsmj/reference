<body>
The primary function of the IntegrityService is to perform and schedule integrity checks for the different files at a given collection.
It consists of four different entities:
<ul>
  <li>IntegrityModel - The storage of the collected integrity data.</li>
  <li>IntegrityChecker - The instance for performing the validation of the integrity of the files within the collection.</li>
  <li>Collector - Collects the integrity data from the pillars by using the clients in the access module.</li>
  <li>Scheduler - Schedules the collection of integrity data.</li>
</ul>

The service performs integrity tasks through different workflows.  
A workflow is an repeatable task, which is scheduled by the scheduler.
It is setup for either collecting data, validating the integrity of data or a combination of these. 
And it is possible to base these tasks upon already collected data.  
<br/>
Currently four different workflows has been created:

<ul>
  <li>CollectAllChecksums: collect all the checksums from all the pillars and afterwards performs an integrity validation on the collected checksums</li>
  <li>CollectAllFileIDs: Collect all the file ids from all the pillars and afterwards performs an integrity check for finding missing files.</li>
  <li>CollecObsoleteChecksums: Goes through all the checksums to find those, which are obsolete. These are collected and afterwards an integrity validation are performed.</li>
  <li>IntegrityValidator: Performs a complete integrity validation on all the data. Validates both the integrity of the checksums and whether the files are missing.</li>
</ul>

</body>
